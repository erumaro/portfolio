2022 version of Eruma Showcase. See the original 2017 version in the [Eruma Showcase repo](https://github.com/erumaro/eruma-showcase).
## Setup

 1. Clone repo.
 2. Run `npm install`.
 3. Run `npm run start` for dev enviroment. Or `npm run build` to create the production version.
 4. Have fun coding! :D

 
## Difference from Eruma Showcase.
The original project was partially built to learn about Redux. However for the type of project it is, that type of complexity is unnecessary. Especialy now that context exist.

Therefore I will not add Redux in this one unless it gets very complex.
A new project with Redux will be created later, most likely a webshop or similar.

Another decision I considered was to remove Axios and use fetch instead. However I decided to keep Axios since it does a lot of good things out of the box that would take extra time from my general app creation. I'll explore this more later after a functioning version is done!
